Retail Transactions Dataset Description:
- Order ID: A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each transaction or customer order. This field ensures traceability and is essential for tracking individual purchases, identifying order patterns, and linking multiple products to the same order. Example: ORD-2025-001234.
- Customer Segment: Indicates the category of the customer making the purchase. Segments typically include Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office, each with distinct buying behaviors and preferences. This field is useful for customer segmentation and targeted marketing analysis.
- Product Category: The broad classification of the product purchased. Categories generally include Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies. Analyzing this field helps in identifying best-performing product lines and revenue contributions across categories.
- Description: A brief textual summary or name of the product purchased. It provides specific identification beyond the general category, enabling product-level analysis. For instance, within the "Technology" category, descriptions might include items like "Wireless Mouse," "Laser Printer," or "Bluetooth Headset." This field can help identify fast-moving SKUs or customer preferences.
- Sales: The total dollar amount generated from the sale of the product in that transaction. This figure reflects gross revenue and is critical for measuring sales volume, forecasting revenue trends, and evaluating top-selling products.
- Profit: The net gain or loss from the sale, calculated after subtracting the cost of goods sold and associated overheads. A positive profit indicates profitability, while a negative value signals a loss on that transaction. Profit analysis aids in margin optimization, discount evaluation, and cost control.
- Review: Customer feedback in the form of a textual review or numerical rating (if applicable). This field provides qualitative insights into customer satisfaction and product/service quality. Analyzing reviews can help improve service quality, detect recurring issues, and refine product offerings. If the field contains text, it may also support sentiment analysis.
Conclusion:
The dataset captures transactions from a retail business. It can be used to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and profitability.
